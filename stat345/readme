STAT 345 Design/Analysis of Experiments: An introduction to the methodology and application of linear models in experimental design. A major focus of the course will be the basic principles of experimental design, such as blocking, randomization and incomplete layouts. Both standard designs, such as fractional factorials and incomplete block designs, as well as nonstandard designs, will be studied within this context. The analysis of these experiments will be developed as well, with particular emphasis on careful model formulation and the role of fixed and random effects. Time permitting, additional topics may include the use of covariates in the analysis of designed experiments, spatial analysis of field trials and Bayesian approaches to analysis of experimental data.
