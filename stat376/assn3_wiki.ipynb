Only the final one (21), which is a mathematics topic (I checked a little further down) is what I would have expected. My guess is that the high influence of the political movement topic is due to the articles on programing languages talking a lot about the philosphies and communities that guide the languages. I can't really explain the medical topic, besides maybe a common theme of technology."

It seems \"Jew\" skews a lot to the religion, nationality, and war topics, while \"Jewish\" is skewed towards political movements. Fascinating."
