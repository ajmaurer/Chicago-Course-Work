This contains work related to my masters paper. 

For my paper, I extended a method developed by my adviser, Rina Barber, on controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) with regularized linear regression. Her method is based on developing a set of "knockoff" variables which are null predictors but mimic the sufficient statistic of the original variables. In a L1 regularized regression, these should enter the model at about the same rate as the original variables, if the originals are non-predictive. I extended this by developing a different way of generating different knockoff variables with the same properties for correlated binary data, which should work better for non-normal error and possibly in L1 regularized generalized linear models.
