This is the work I completed for courses while finishing a Masters of Science in Statistics at the University of Chicago. All my programing work and write ups, to the extent I used latex, will be here. Each course has a separate folder.

Fall Semester 2014
-STAT 343 Applied Linear Stat Method: This course introduces the theory, methods, and applications of fitting and interpreting multiple regression models. Topics include the examination of residuals, the transformation of data, strategies and criteria for the selection of a regression equation, nonlinear models, biases due to excluded variables and measurement error, and the use and interpretation of computer package regression programs. The theoretical basis of the methods, the relation to linear algebra, and the effects of violations of assumptions are studied. Techniques discussed are illustrated by examples involving both physical and social sciences data.
-STAT 347 Nonparametric Inference: Nonparametric inference is about developing statistical methods and models that make weak assumptions. A typical nonparametric approach estimates a nonlinear function from an infinite dimensional space, rather than a linear model from a finite dimensional space. This course gives an introduction to nonparametric inference, with a focus on density estimation, regression, confidence sets, orthogonal functions, random processes, and kernels. The course treats nonparametric methodology and its use, together with theory that explains the statistical properties of the methods. 
-STAT 304 Distribution Theory: This course is a systematic introduction to random variables and probability distributions. Topics include standard distributions (i.e., uniform, normal, beta, gamma, F, t, Cauchy, Poisson, binomial, and hypergeometric); moments and cumulants; characteristic functions; exponential families; modes of convergence; central limit theorem; other asymptotic approximations.

Winter Semester 2015
-STAT 301 Mathematical Statistics 1: This course is part of a two-quarter sequence on the theory of statistics. Topics will include exponential, curved exponential, and location-scale families; mixtures, hierarchical and conditional modeling including compatibility of conditional distributions; multivariate normal and joint distributions of quadratic forms of multivariate normal; principles of estimation; identifiability, sufficiency, minimal sufficiency, ancillarity, completeness; properties of the likelihood function and likelihood-based inference, both univariate and multivariate, including examples in which the usual regularity conditions do not hold; multivariate information inequality. Part of the course will be devoted to elementary asymptotic methods that are useful in the practice of statistics, including methods to derive asymptotic distributions of various estimators and test statistics, such as Pearson's chi-square, standard and non-standard asymptotics of maximum likelihood estimators, asymptotics of order statistics and extreme order statistics, Cramer's theorem including situations in which the second-order term is needed, asymptotic efficiency. Other topics (e.g. methods for dependent observations) may be covered if time permits.
-STAT 310 Convex Optimization: This course covers the fundamentals of convex optimization. Topics will include basic convex geometry and convex analysis, KKT condition, Fenchel and Lagrange duality theory; six standard convex optimization problems and their properties and applications: linear programming, geometric programming, second-order cone programming, semidefinite programming, linearly and quadratically constrained quadratic programming. In the last part of the course we will examine the generalized moment problem --- a powerful technique that allows one to encode a wide variety of problems (in probability, statistics, control theory, financial mathematics, signal processing, etc) and solve them or their relaxations as convex optimization problems. 
-STAT 336 Time Dependent Data: This course considers the modeling and analysis of data that are ordered in time. The main focus will be on quantitative observations taken at evenly spaced intervals and will include both time-domain and spectral approaches. Time permitting, statistical approaches to other data types, such as multiple time series, categorical observations or point processes, will be considered.
-STAT 345 Design/Analysis of Experiments: An introduction to the methodology and application of linear models in experimental design. A major focus of the course will be the basic principles of experimental design, such as blocking, randomization and incomplete layouts. Both standard designs, such as fractional factorials and incomplete block designs, as well as nonstandard designs, will be studied within this context. The analysis of these experiments will be developed as well, with particular emphasis on careful model formulation and the role of fixed and random effects. Time permitting, additional topics may include the use of covariates in the analysis of designed experiments, spatial analysis of field trials and Bayesian approaches to analysis of experimental data.
