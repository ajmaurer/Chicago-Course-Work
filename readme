This is the work I completed for courses while finishing a Masters of Science in Statistics at the University of Chicago. Each course will have its own folder

Fall Semester 2014
-STAT 343 Applied Linear Stat Method: Course primarily on linear regression
-STAT 347 Nonparametric Inference: Nonparametric statistical modeling and analysis, including some popular machine learning techniques 
-STAT 304 Distribution Theory: Rigerous probability theory, at least as rigerous as it gets without using measure theory
