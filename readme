This is the work I completed for courses while finishing a Masters of Science in Statistics at the University of Chicago. All my programing work and write ups, to the extent I used latex, will be here. Each course has a separate folder.

Fall Semester 2014
-STAT 343 Applied Linear Stat Method: This course introduces the theory, methods, and applications of fitting and interpreting multiple regression models. Topics include the examination of residuals, the transformation of data, strategies and criteria for the selection of a regression equation, nonlinear models, biases due to excluded variables and measurement error, and the use and interpretation of computer package regression programs. The theoretical basis of the methods, the relation to linear algebra, and the effects of violations of assumptions are studied. Techniques discussed are illustrated by examples involving both physical and social sciences data.
-STAT 347 Nonparametric Inference: Nonparametric inference is about developing statistical methods and models that make weak assumptions. A typical nonparametric approach estimates a nonlinear function from an infinite dimensional space, rather than a linear model from a finite dimensional space. This course gives an introduction to nonparametric inference, with a focus on density estimation, regression, confidence sets, orthogonal functions, random processes, and kernels. The course treats nonparametric methodology and its use, together with theory that explains the statistical properties of the methods. 
-STAT 304 Distribution Theory: This course is a systematic introduction to random variables and probability distributions. Topics include standard distributions (i.e., uniform, normal, beta, gamma, F, t, Cauchy, Poisson, binomial, and hypergeometric); moments and cumulants; characteristic functions; exponential families; modes of convergence; central limit theorem; other asymptotic approximations.

Winter Semester 2015
-STAT 301 Mathematical Statistics 1: This course is part of a two-quarter sequence on the theory of statistics. Topics will include exponential, curved exponential, and location-scale families; mixtures, hierarchical and conditional modeling including compatibility of conditional distributions; multivariate normal and joint distributions of quadratic forms of multivariate normal; principles of estimation; identifiability, sufficiency, minimal sufficiency, ancillarity, completeness; properties of the likelihood function and likelihood-based inference, both univariate and multivariate, including examples in which the usual regularity conditions do not hold; multivariate information inequality. Part of the course will be devoted to elementary asymptotic methods that are useful in the practice of statistics, including methods to derive asymptotic distributions of various estimators and test statistics, such as Pearson's chi-square, standard and non-standard asymptotics of maximum likelihood estimators, asymptotics of order statistics and extreme order statistics, Cramer's theorem including situations in which the second-order term is needed, asymptotic efficiency. Other topics (e.g. methods for dependent observations) may be covered if time permits.
-STAT 310 Convex Optimization: This course covers the fundamentals of convex optimization. Topics will include basic convex geometry and convex analysis, KKT condition, Fenchel and Lagrange duality theory; six standard convex optimization problems and their properties and applications: linear programming, geometric programming, second-order cone programming, semidefinite programming, linearly and quadratically constrained quadratic programming. In the last part of the course we will examine the generalized moment problem --- a powerful technique that allows one to encode a wide variety of problems (in probability, statistics, control theory, financial mathematics, signal processing, etc) and solve them or their relaxations as convex optimization problems. 
-STAT 336 Time Dependent Data: This course considers the modeling and analysis of data that are ordered in time. The main focus will be on quantitative observations taken at evenly spaced intervals and will include both time-domain and spectral approaches. Time permitting, statistical approaches to other data types, such as multiple time series, categorical observations or point processes, will be considered. (Auditing)
-STAT 345 Design/Analysis of Experiments: An introduction to the methodology and application of linear models in experimental design. A major focus of the course will be the basic principles of experimental design, such as blocking, randomization and incomplete layouts. Both standard designs, such as fractional factorials and incomplete block designs, as well as nonstandard designs, will be studied within this context. The analysis of these experiments will be developed as well, with particular emphasis on careful model formulation and the role of fixed and random effects. Time permitting, additional topics may include the use of covariates in the analysis of designed experiments, spatial analysis of field trials and Bayesian approaches to analysis of experimental data.

Spring Semester 2015
-STAT 302 Bayesian Analysis and Principles of Statistics: This course continues the development of Mathematical Statistics, with an emphasis on Bayesian analysis and underlying principles of inference. Topics include Bayesian Inference and Computation, Frequentist Inference and interpretation of p values and confidence intervals, Decision theory, admissibility and Stein’s paradox, the Likelihood principle, Exchangeability and De Finetti’s theorem, hierarchical modelling, multiple comparisons and False Discovery Rates. The mathematical level will generally be at that of an easy advanced calculus course. We will assume familiarity with standard statistical distributions (e.g., Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Exponential), with the laws of probability, expectation, conditional expectation, etc, and exposure to common statistical concepts such as p values and confidence intervals. Familiarity with the R statistical language will be helpful. Concepts will be illustrated mainly by instructive “toy” examples, where calculations can be done by hand. However, we will also study more complex, practical applications of Bayesian statistics. Although some basic methods of computation will be discussed, the primary focus will be on concepts and not on computation.
-STAT 347 Generalized Linear Models: This applied course covers factors, variates, contrasts, and interactions; exponential-family models (i.e., variance function); definition of a generalized linear model (i.e., link functions); specific examples of GLMs; logistic and probit regression; cumulative logistic models; log-linear models and contingency tables; inverse linear models; Quasi-likelihood and least squares; estimating functions; and partially linear models.
-STAT 376 Machine Learning and Large-Scale Data Analysis: This course is an introduction to machine learning and the  analysis of large data sets using distributed computation and storage  infrastructure. Basic machine learning methodology and relevant  statistical theory will be presented in lectures. Homework exercises  will give students hands-on experience with the methods on different  types of data. Methods include algorithms for clustering, binary  classification, and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. Data types include  images, archives of scientific articles, online ad clickthrough logs,  and public records of the City of Chicago. Programming will be based on  Python and R, but previous exposure to these languages is not assumed. (Auditing)
-STAT 377 Machine Learning: This course provides hands-on experience with a range of contemporary machine learning algorithms, as well as an introduction to the theoretical aspects of the subject. Topics covered include: the PAC framework, elements of computational learning theory, the VC dimension, boosting, Bayesian learning, graphical models, clustering, dimensionality reduction, linear classifiers, kernel methods including SVMs, and an introduction to statistical learning theory.
